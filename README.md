# RISC-V CORE USING TL-VERILOG WORKSHOP
This repository contains codes and information that were designed as part of [RISC-V based MYTH workshop](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/riscv-based-myth/). As part of this workshop participants were introduced to RISC-V GCC Toolchain, TL-Verilog and makerchip platform which helped to understand RISC-V architecture.
## Table of Contents
- Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU Compiler chain
- Introduction to ABI and basic verification using iverilog
- Digital logic design using TL-Verliog and Makerchip
- Basic RISC-V CPU Architecture
- Pipelined RISC-V CPU micro-architecture
